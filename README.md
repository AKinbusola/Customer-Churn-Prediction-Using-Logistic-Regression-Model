# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-Model

Customer Churn is a burning problem for Telecom companies. In this project involve simulation of one such case of customer churn where I worked on a data of postpaid customers with a contract. The data (“Cellphone.xlsx”) has information about customer usage behavior, contract details, and payment details. The data also indicates which were the customers who canceled their service (“churn = 1”). Based on this past data, we need to build a model which can predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future or not. The fllowing task were accompanished
- Explorartory Data analysis
- Multicollinearity check
- Spliting the data into train set (80%) and test set (20%)
- Logistic Regression Model building: selection of the best model with train set
- Comparing the models performances using confusion matrix and other evaluation measures.
